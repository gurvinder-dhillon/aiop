# Agent-Oriented Programming (AiOP)

A modern landing page showcasing the future of software development through Agent-Oriented Programming.

## 🌟 Overview

This project presents the concept of Agent-Oriented Programming (AiOP) - a revolutionary paradigm that extends beyond Object-Oriented Programming by introducing native language constructs for AI agents, tools, and orchestration.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modern Design**: Beautiful, responsive landing page with animated backgrounds
- **Interactive Elements**: Scroll-reveal animations and floating particle effects
- **Code Comparisons**: Side-by-side comparisons of traditional OOP vs AiOP
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully responsive design that works on all devices
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight and fast-loading

## 📋 Sections

1. **Hero Section** - Introduction to Agent-Oriented Programming
2. **Paradigm Shift** - Visual comparison between OOP and AiOP
3. **Benefits** - Key advantages of the AiOP approach
4. **Statistics** - Market data and industry insights
5. **Multi-Language Support** - Examples in Python and JavaScript
6. **Call to Action** - Links to proposal and community

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Interactive features and animations
